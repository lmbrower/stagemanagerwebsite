            The Stage Manager's Book is an app dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of stage management by providing a fully digital platform for productions while also contributing to environmental sustainability.
            By the end of this project, we will have implemented a number of different features.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Profiles:</b> Each user can create a public profile to share their headshot, bio, and resume with others.</li>
                <li><b>Script:</b>> Each production's director can upload a script, which they (and authorized users) can annotate. All other members of the production can view these annotations in real-time.</li>
                <li><b>Calendar:</b> The stage manager can upload and modify the production calendar. Everytime a change is made to the calendar, all relevant users are notified.</li>
                <li><b>Designer:</b> Members of the crew an upload and share design files in this tab.</li>
                <li><b>Memories:</b> All members of the cast and crew can share behind-the-scenes photos and videos here.</li>
                <li><b>Discussion:</b> This will function as a public discussion forum; all members of the crew can make and reply to posts here.</li>
                <li><b>Chat:</b> Members of a production can send each other private direct messages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            All tabs of this app will be organized by hub. Each production has a hub. Members of the cast and crew who are in multiple productions simultaneously will view seperate discussion, designer, etc. pages for each production.
